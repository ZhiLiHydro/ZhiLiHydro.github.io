There are many ways to perform a "diff" on two TEX files and compile the "diff"-ed TEX file to a PDF file, but the following way may be one of the most convenient ones:

Step 1: Install [latexdiff](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexdiff). On a Windows machine, Perl has to be installed before installing latexdiff. 

Step 2: Compare two TEX files by 

```
latexdiff manuscript_before_revision.tex manuscript_after_revision.tex > diff.tex
```

Step 3: Compile `diff.tex`. A PDF file with all changes highlighted will be generated (see the example below). If working on Overleaf, don't forget to change the "Main document" to `diff.tex` after uploading `diff.tex` to the working project.
