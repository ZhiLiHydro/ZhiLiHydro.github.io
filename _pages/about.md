I am a PhD candidate at Ven Te Chow Hydrosystems Lab, Dept. of CEE, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am working with [Prof. Marcelo H. Garc√≠a](https://cee.illinois.edu/directory/profile/mhgarcia) on hydraulics, sediment transport and fluvial geomorphology. My primary reserach interest is numerical modeling of meandering river migration and meander cutoffs. I am also interested in a broader range of topics in geophysical flow and solute transport, such as river bifurcation & confluence, urban hydrology & hydraulics, river-lake hydraulic interaction, etc. Here's my [CV](https://zhilihydro.github.io/cv/).

#### News
  - [**Spring'20**] One 1st-author abstract on chute cutoff modeling and one 3rd-author abstract on meander dynamics in peat were accepted for presentation at [River Flow 2020](http://riverflow2020.org/), but the physical meeting is not going to happen due to the reason we all know. Another abstract studying human impact on long term meander dynamics was accpeted for presentation at the [International Conference on the Status and Future of the World's Large Rivers](http://worldslargerivers.boku.ac.at/wlr/), but the conference was postponed to 2021 due to the same reason.

  - [**Nov'19**] An abstract/poster [Numerical modeling on meander chute cutoffs using hybrid deterministic-stochastic method](https://storage.googleapis.com/wzukusers/user-30969499/documents/a361e67581b74ac6abff4ad83da6d3e5/RCEM%202019%20Abstracts%20Book%20Online.pdf) was presented on the [11th River, Coastal and Estuarine Morphodynamics Symposium](https://www.rcem2019.co.nz/).


Prior to becoming an [Illini](https://fightingillini.com/), in 2014, I completed my M.S. degree in Environmental Engineering at Michigan State University. I was introduced to the world of geophysical flow modeling in Dr. Li's groundwater modeling lab, where I was primarily working on a dam removal project in Michigan. In 2012, I completed my B.S. degree in Geology at Nanjing University, where I completed my B.S. thesis on CO2 sequestration using a kind of mineral called serpentine.
