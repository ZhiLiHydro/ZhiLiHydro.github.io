I am a PhD student at Ven Te Chow Hydrosystems Lab, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign working with [Prof. Marcelo H. Garc√≠a](https://cee.illinois.edu/directory/profile/mhgarcia) on hydraulics, sediment transport and fluvial geomorphology. My primary reserach interest is numerical modeling of meandering river migration and meander cutoffs. I am also interested in a broader range of topics in geophysical flow and solute transport: river bifurcation & confluence, urban hydrology & hydraulics, river-lake hydraulic interaction, etc. Here's my [CV](https://zhilihydro.github.io/cv/).

#### News
  - Nov'19. An abstract/poster [Numerical modeling on meander chute cutoffs using hybrid deterministic-stochastic method](https://storage.googleapis.com/wzukusers/user-30969499/documents/a361e67581b74ac6abff4ad83da6d3e5/RCEM%202019%20Abstracts%20Book%20Online.pdf) was presented on the [11th River, Coastal and Estuarine Morphodynamics Symposium](https://www.rcem2019.co.nz/).


Prior to becoming an [Illini](https://fightingillini.com/), in 2014, I completed my MS degree in Environmental Engineering at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/). I was introduced to the world of geophysical flow modeling in Dr. Li's groundwater modeling lab, where I was primarily working on a dam removal project in Michigan. In 2012, I completed my BS in Geology at Nanjing University, where I completed my BS thesis on CO2 sequestration using a kind of mineral called serpentine.
