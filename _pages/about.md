I am Zhi Li and I earned Ph.D. at the Ven Te Chow Hydrosystems Laboratory, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, supervised by Prof. [Marcelo H. GarcÃ­a](https://cee.illinois.edu/directory/profile/mhgarcia). My Ph.D. thesis focuses on developing numerical models to study river meandering and cutoff dynamics. My broader research interests include **Environmental Flow Mechanics**, **Sediment Transport**, **Fluvial Geomorphology** and **Computational Fluid Dynamics**. Here's my [short CV](https://zhilihydro.github.io/cv/).

Prior to becoming an [Illini](https://fightingillini.com/), in 2014, I completed my M.S. degree in Environmental Engineering at Michigan State University. I was introduced to the world of geophysical flow modeling in the Groundwater Modeling Lab at MSU. In 2012, I completed my B.S. degree in Geosciences with Geology specialization at Nanjing University.
