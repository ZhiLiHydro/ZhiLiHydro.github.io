I am Zhi Li, a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Atmospheric, Climate, and Earth Sciences Division](https://www.pnnl.gov/atmospheric-climate-and-earth-sciences-division) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ([PNNL](https://www.pnnl.gov/)) located in Richland, Washington, USA. At PNNL, I am focusing on developing and applying hydro-biogeochemical numerical models to solve real-world watershed and ecosystem science problems. I received my PhD in Water Resources Engineering & Science from the Ven Te Chow Hydrosystems Laboratory, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign ([UIUC](https://illinois.edu/)), where I was trained as a geophysical flow and transport modeler. My PhD thesis focused on the development of numerical models to study river meandering and cutoff dynamics, supervised by Professor [Marcelo H. GarcÃ­a](https://cee.illinois.edu/directory/profile/mhgarcia). Here is my [short CV](https://zhilihydro.github.io/cv/).
