I am Zhi Li, a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), focusing on watershed science using hydrologic and biogeochemical numerical modeling approach. I received my PhD in Water Resources Engineering & Science from the Ven Te Chow Hydrosystems Laboratory, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I was trained as a geophysical flow and transport modeler. My PhD thesis research was supervised by Prof. [Marcelo H. GarcÃ­a](https://cee.illinois.edu/directory/profile/mhgarcia), and it focused on the development of numerical models to study river meandering and cutoff dynamics. Here's my [short CV](https://zhilihydro.github.io/cv/).
