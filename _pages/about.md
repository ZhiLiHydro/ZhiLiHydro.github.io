I am Zhi Li, a PhD candidate at the Ven Te Chow Hydrosystems Laboratory, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, working with Prof. [Marcelo H. García](https://cee.illinois.edu/directory/profile/mhgarcia). My PhD thesis focuses on developing numerical models on river meandering and cutoff problems. My broader research interests include **Environmental Flow Mechanics**, **Sediment Transport**, **Fluvial Geomorphology** and **Computational Fluid Dynamics**. Here's my [short CV](https://zhilihydro.github.io/cv/) and [full CV](https://zhilihydro.github.io/files/CV_web_Zhi_Li.pdf).

Prior to becoming an [Illini](https://fightingillini.com/), in 2014, I completed my M.S. degree in Environmental Engineering at Michigan State University. I was introduced to the world of geophysical flow modeling in the Groundwater Modeling Lab at MSU. In 2012, I completed my B.S. degree in Geosciences with Geology specialization at Nanjing University.
