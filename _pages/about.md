I am Zhi Li, a PhD candidate at the Ven Te Chow Hydrosystems Laboratory, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, working with Prof. [Marcelo H. Garc√≠a](https://cee.illinois.edu/directory/profile/mhgarcia). My research interests include **Environmental Flow Mechanics**, **Sediment Transport** and **Fluvial Geomorphology**. Here's my [short CV](https://zhilihydro.github.io/cv/) and full [CV].

#### News
  - [**Summer'20**] Gave a talk on *pyRiverBed:  A Python framework to generate synthetic riverbed topography of constant-width meandering rivers* at [CSDMS Summer Science Series](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/MeetingOfInterest:Meeting-399). Recorded video can be found [here](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Webinars).

  - [**Spring'20**] One 1st-author abstract on chute cutoff modeling and one 3rd-author abstract on meander dynamics in peat were accepted for presentation at [River Flow 2020](http://riverflow2020.org/). Another abstract studying human impact on long term meander dynamics was accpeted for presentation at the [International Conference on the Status and Future of the World's Large Rivers](http://worldslargerivers.boku.ac.at/wlr/).

  - [**Fall'19**] An abstract/poster [Numerical modeling on meander chute cutoffs using hybrid deterministic-stochastic method](https://storage.googleapis.com/wzukusers/user-30969499/documents/a361e67581b74ac6abff4ad83da6d3e5/RCEM%202019%20Abstracts%20Book%20Online.pdf) was presented on the [11th River, Coastal and Estuarine Morphodynamics Symposium](https://www.rcem2019.co.nz/).


Prior to becoming an [Illini](https://fightingillini.com/), in 2014, I completed my M.S. degree in Environmental Engineering at Michigan State University. I was introduced to the world of geophysical flow modeling in the Groundwater Modeling Lab, where I was primarily working on the analysis of dam removal project in Michigan. In 2012, I completed my B.S. degree in Geosciences with Geology specialization at Nanjing University, where I completed my B.S. thesis on CO2 sequestration using serpentine.
