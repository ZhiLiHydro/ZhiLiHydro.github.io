Mentored two students. Gave them a mini-project on the numerical simulation of a fish-ladder. Proposed two final projects for them to participate the [Undergraduate Research Symposium (URS)](https://undergradresearch.illinois.edu/symposium.html): 1) Simulating the Chicago River Flooding Issue, and 2) Reverse Engineering Hydraulic Modeling Visualization Tools by Implementing Delaunay Triangulation using Java.
